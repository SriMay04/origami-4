It is also highly probable <br> that the process of folding was applied to other materials <br> before paper was invented, so the origins of recreational folding <br> may lie with cloth or leather.</p>

It is also known that  <br>the Arab world was making paper in the eight century, and t <br>he Moors brought paper folding to Spain in the twelf <br>th century.</p>

        text-shadow: 4pt 4pt 10pt #f1ebeb; width:600px"> The Japanese word "origami" itself is a compound of two smaller <br> Japanese words: "ori" (root verb "oru"), meaning to fold, and "kami", <br> meaning paper. Until recently, not all forms of paper folding were <br> grouped under the word origami. ... In 1797 the first  <br>known origami book was published in Japan: Senbazuru orikata.</p>
